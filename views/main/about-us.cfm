                    <p>
                        The goal of the Migrant Education Program is to ensure that all migrant students 
                        reach challenging academic standards and graduate with a high school diploma (or complete a GED) 
                        that prepares them for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment. 
                        As a support office funded through a Migrant Education state grant, the MSDRS Office plays 
                        an important role in administering of state program directives. A working agreement between 
                        the administrator of the grant (Sunnyside School District) and the grantor and program director 
                        (Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction in Olympia) ensures that all program activities 
                        are implemented.
